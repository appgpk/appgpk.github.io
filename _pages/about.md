I’m Marie, a PhD Candidate in Economics at Simon Fraser University. My primary fields of interest are Development Economics and Behavioral Economics.

My current research agenda has two main strands. First, I study how conflict shapes political preferences, with a particular focus on support for democracy in low-democracy contexts. Second, I am currently working on a paper that examines how belief systems influence economic and social decision-making in developing settings.

Beyond research, I am passionate about translating data into insights that support better decision-making. I have a strong interest in improving data collection in developing country. One approach I explore is digitalization, which I am currently implementing in my own business. Working at this intersection has allowed me to identify real-world frictions in data collection and management and to think critically about solutions that effectively bridge traditional practices and digital tools.
